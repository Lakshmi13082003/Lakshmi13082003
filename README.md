👋 Hi there, I'm Lakshmi Manoj
🔐 Cybersecurity Specialist | Penetration Tester | VAPT Practitioner | Secure Developer

🛡️ About Me
I am a cybersecurity professional with strong hands-on expertise in Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT).
I specialize in identifying security weaknesses, exploiting vulnerabilities ethically, and providing structured remediation strategies to strengthen system defenses.
With a strong foundation in both offensive security and secure software development, I bridge the gap between identifying vulnerabilities and building secure, resilient systems.
